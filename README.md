MIDI File Mapper is a utility that allows you to remap the notes in MIDI files. This is particularly useful when converting GM drum patterns for a specific drum sampler or converting between loops for two different samplers.

MIDI File Mapper ships with some built-in mappings for popular drum samplers and allows you to create your own, as well as import maps from Cakewalk SONAR or Steinberg Cubase.

MIDI File Mapper is powered by the [NAudio .NET Audio Library](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/).

# Contribute

We are looking for people to contribute drum mapping rule files, particularly to convert between major drum samplers (BFD, EZDrummer, Addictive Drums, DFH etc) and General MIDI. Please use CodePlex to get in touch if you would like to provide a drum mapping to be part of the next MIDI File Mapper Release.
